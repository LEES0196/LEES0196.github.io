My name is Sujong Lee, an undergraduate student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (Minor in Mathematics) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

I am currently an undergraduate researcher at Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. Ruqi Zhang, working on sampling problems in discrete domains. I am also an AI Researcher Intern at NanoforgeAI, Korea, researching applications of neural samplers on material discovery.

My research interests broadly lie in applied mathematics for machine learning. I am specifically interested in mathematical understanding and efficiency of neural networks and generative models. Recently, I am studying diffusion models, flow models and their variations in connection to optimal transport and stochastic control. Previously, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Bihan Wen, Prof. Taehyoung (Tony) Kim, and Prof. Donguk Nam.

You can find my curriculum vitae [here](http://lees0196.github.io/files/SujongLee.pdf).
