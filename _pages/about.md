My name is Sujong Lee, 3rd year undergraduate in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with a minor in Mathematics at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

I am currently an undergraduate researcher in ROSE Lab @ NTU under supervision of Professor Bihan, Wen. My research interests lie in computer vision, generative model, and applied mathematics. I am currently interested in diffusion and flow-based generative model, especially their efficiency and connection to optimal transport. Previously, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Taehyoung, Kim and Donguk, Nam.

You can find my curriculum vitae [here](http://lees0196.github.io/files/SujongLee.pdf).

I have lived in 4 different countries, Korea, Turkiye, Thailand and Singapore, and travelled through numerous different countries. I enjoy playing international chess and League of Legends.
