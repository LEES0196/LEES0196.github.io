Sampling from an unnormalized probability mass function on a large discrete state space is a core problem in statistical physics and probabilistic inference, yet most learning-based samplers are designed for continuous diffusions. We introduce the Discrete Controlled Monte Carlo (DCMC) sampler, a neural sampler based on controlled continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). DCMC transports samples from an easy prior to an intractable target by following a prescribed curve of intermediate time marginals and learning a control over CTMC jump rates. DCMC is trained with a physics-informed neural network (PINN) objective that upper bounds the log-variance divergence of the forward-backward path likelihood ratio and yields importance weights for estimating expectations and normalizing constants.
